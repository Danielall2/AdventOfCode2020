# AdventOfCode2020
This is my current attempt at the challenge Advent of Code 2020. At the time of writing this file, challenges 1 - 16 have been attempted. Day 7 has yet to be solved while 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 have yet to have their second part solved. The puzzle data used for each piece of code has been saved in the main/resources folder as csv files, and the solutions for each day in the calendar have been saved in their own directory. A separate directory has been used named io (input output) to convert the data from the csv files to a useable format.

The main code (called App) has been used to call the methods from each puzzle. Therefore simply running the App file will print the answers needed to the console.
